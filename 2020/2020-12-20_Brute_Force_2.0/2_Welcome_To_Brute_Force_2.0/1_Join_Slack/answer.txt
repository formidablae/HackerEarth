If you're asking a question, please search first  to make sure that you question has not been answered already.
Please be respectful and cosiderate to the other members of the competition.
You must have received a mail which says to submit the project, please ignore that e-mail, it's an automated mail sent by our system, it has nothing to do with our CTF challenge.
Don't DM any admin for any query, we are a community, please ask your questions publically so that everyone can help you out.
